## Bring up the Find menu

##### In Atom

In the menubar, you can either click on __Find > Find in Buffer__. 

Or better yet, just use the keyboard shortcut: __Command + F__ 

The __Find Panel__ should pop up at the bottom of the window:

###### Activate regex in Atom

To activate the use of regular expressions in Atom's find, click the button that has the dot-asterisk symbol: `.*`. Clicking it should highlight it (in a too subtle way). There is some text in the right side of the Find panel that should read something like:

      Finding with Options: Regex

##### In Sublime Text

In the menubar, click __Find > Find...__. Or rather, use the keyboard shortcut: __Command + F__. In Sublime Text, you'll probably find yourself hitting __Command + Option + F__, as it brings up the option to do a __Find and Replace__.

Sublime Text's button to enable regular expressions looks like Atom's, with the dot-asterisk symbol, `.*`, except annoyingly small and even more difficult to tell if it's clicked:

## Search for a word with Find

A regular expression is just a _pattern of text_. If your pattern is simply the literal word, `Enter`, then the text editor's __Find__ function works just as it does in any other word processor you've used. Just type `Enter` into the Find box and hit the __Find button__.

If you performed a __case-insensitive__ search, you would've found __2,519__ instances of the word `Enter` in the Shakespearean text. 

## Search for a regex with Find

Finding the _literal_ pattern of characters that make the word `Enter` -- you already knew how to do that. To use a regular expression, you just have to use the special characters that have special meaning in the regex syntax. What are those characters? Too many to learn in a single session. So rather than point you to a cheat sheet or reference, I'll demonstrate the concept with a few examples.

##### Finding "Enter" at the beginning of a line

In the __Find__ box, type a __carat__ before the word `Enter`:

      ^Enter

When _not_ searching for a regex, the editor would attempt to find that _literal_ pattern -- and it won't find any in the text. However, in __regex mode__, the editor interprets the `^` _not_ as a _literal_ carat, but as the symbol that means: "_Look for the beginning of a line_"

With this regex pattern, the search results only include `Enter` -- __602__ instances -- when it appears at the beginning of a line:

##### The word "enter" followed by letters

Sometimes we only want a pattern that is part of a word. What words have the pattern `enter`, followed by more letters? The words `enters`, `entered`, `entertain` come to mind. Here's how to match them with a regex:

      enter\w

In this example, the letter `w` is not interpreted as a _literal_ `w`. Instead, that __backslash__ character -- `\` -- _modifies_ the meaning of whatever character follows it. In this case, the regex `\w` means: _match any alphanumeric character_, e.g. `A`, `z`, `9`, as well as the __underscore__ character, `_`.

Note: if you have the __case-insensitive__ option turned on, it shouldn't matter if the pattern is `enter\w` or `ENTER\w`.


##### The word "enter" following other letters

What about words in which `enter` follows other letters? To be honest, no examples immediately come to me. But we can find out by modifying the previous pattern to put `\w` _before_ `enter`:

      \wenter

At first, it looks like we're searching for the word, `wenter`. But again, the backslash operator turns that `w` into something else _besides_ a _literal_ `w`. In all of Shakespeare, this pattern appears just __9__ times, mostly within the word `carpenter`.


##### Just the word "enter"

In real world text-mining, we often care about a specific word, such as `eat`, while not caring for `peat` or `Eaton`. The pattern `\b` denotes a __word boundary__, such as a hyphen, dot, comma, apostrophe, space, and beginning and end of a line:

      \benter\b

##### Repetition

The pattern `\d` acts as a stand-in for __any numerical digit__. What if we want to find all instances of 4-digits in a row? We can simply repeat the pattern 4 times:

      \d\d\d\d

Of course, this seems like something in which there _must_ be a better way. And there is: __curly braces__ are interpreted as specifying a specific number of matches of the preceding token. To find four-digit numbers with curly brace notation:

      \d{4}

If we want _any_ sequence of digits, whether it's just a single digit or 20 digits in a row, the __plus sign__ is interpreted as: __one or more of the preceding token__:

      \d+


##### Character sets and alternation

Shakespeare often uses _apostrophes_ in place of letters; compare the variations of the word "never"

> May you a better feast never behold
> 
> Come, come, beshrew your heart! You'll ne'er be good
> 
> Nev'r did poor steward wear a truer grief

If we wanted to find all instances in which Shakespeare means "never", we could of course do three separate searches. However, with the __pipe__ operator -- `|` -- which is interpreted as __or__, we can fit multiple variations into one search:

    never|nev'r|ne'er

However, in real world situations, we often just don't _know_ what the exact variations are. But we may know, generally, what they _could_ be. If you only knew that the 3rd and 4th characters of `never` might either (or both) be `'` or `e` or `v`, you could use the pipe operator and then use __parentheses__ to specify the grouping (in the way that parentheses are used in arithmetic to specify priority of operations):

    ne(v|e|'){2}r


The use of __square brackets__ can be used to more concisely express a set of alternate characters:

    nev[ve']{2}r

In many real world documents, we're often interested in numbers that might represent amounts of money, e.g. `$500` and `$1,300,555.99`, i.e. a combination of numbers, dots, and commas. Here's a sloppy, but quick pattern that's usually good enough:

    [0-9.,]

There's a lot of other ways to express a range of characters, but it's good enough for now just to know that you can do that type of search.


##### Escaping special characters

I'll close with one more important concept: what if we want to match a character, _literally_, that has a special meaning as regex? For example, the __dot character__, which I haven't mentioned, is a regex character that will match __anything__. For example, the following pattern will find all instances in which the letter `h` is followed by __any character__, and then followed by the letter `m`:

      h.z

This would match text strings such as "...with zealous..." and "__haz__ard". But what if I want to find the word `ham` followed by a _literal_ period, such as a sentence that ends with `ham`, or, as is the convention in the Gutenberg text, `Ham.`, to denote lines spoken by the character Hamlet?

To specify the _literal_ meaning of a character -- often referred to as __escaping__ a character, we simply prepend a __backslash__:

      ham\.

What if we want to match a _literal backslash_? Just precede a backslash with a backslash:

      \\



# Replacing with regex

Although regexes are useful enough just for finding text, they are incredibly useful when you need to replace a pattern. For example, we could replace all the variations of `never` in one swoop. When it comes to data cleaning -- an all too common chore in data work -- regular expressions can do quick work.

For example, in the Shakespeare text we've downloaded, you've probably noticed that most lines have their first characters not flush against the beginning of the line:

~~~
Enter two GENTLEMEN, at several doors

  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Whither away so fast?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. O, God save ye!
    Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become
~~~

How would you convert that text to this (not that you would want to):

~~~
Enter two GENTLEMEN, at several doors

FIRST GENTLEMAN. Whither away so fast?
SECOND GENTLEMAN. O, God save ye!
Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become
~~~

Even if you don't remember the exact syntax, you should aspire to think about this problem in patterns:

- We want to "replace" (or rather, _delete_) only the spaces that occur at the __beginning of the line__.
- Each line to be adjusted has __one or more__ of these spaces in a row.

After you've thought it through, then you can look up the specific syntax. For this scenario, all the regex you need has been covered in this lesson:

(Warning: there are more than 100,000+ such matches...attempting this regex may cause your computer to slow to a crawl)

# Know that there are patterns

This should feel like a __staggering__ amount of things to memorize. Because it is. Regular expressions are a _language_, albeit a relatively small one. So it can take years to attain a working memorization of it. 

But you don't have to memorize it; most people don't. It's more than enough to just _know_ that this flexible searching power exists.

You can move on to the [command-line version of this lesson](/lessons/shakespeare-cli-regex), which includes more examples of useful regex. Or to the more real-world example involving a search through [State Secretary Hillary Clinton's emails](/lessons/hillary-clinton-emails-grep).
