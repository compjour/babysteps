These shell commands (written in the Bash syntax):

- grep grep example.txt
- grep "grep example.txt"
- grep "$grep" example.txt
- grep '$grep' example.txt

They look very similar, but they all do very different things.

- She said she's selling Sarah's seashells.
- She said, "She's selling Sarah's seashells."
- "She said, 'She's selling Sarah's seashells.'"
