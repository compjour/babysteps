# Setting up our environment

## Open your apps

Open:

- Chrome (you're probably already on it)
- Terminal
- Finder (this is always open on OS X)

Notice that we don't need to open up Excel.


## Practice your keyboarding

If you have a small monitor and can't squeeze the Terminal and Chrome on the same screen, it's OK. This is a great chance to practice reflexively using the keyboard to get around your operating system.

Use __Command-Tab__ to switch between the two applications. 

<%= kbset("Command", "Tab") %>

Use __Tab__, when in Terminal, to do auto-complete.

<%= kbset("Tab") %>


# Getting the data

TK How we get the data

## Making a new directory

~~~sh
$ cd /tmp                # Change into /tmp/ directory
$ mkdir babynames        # Make the directory babynames/ inside of /tmp/
$ cd babynames           # Change into babynames/ directory
~~~

Alternatively, this would have worked:

~~~sh
$ mkdir /tmp/babynames    # Make the directory /tmp/babynames
$ cd /tmp/babynames       # Change into /tmp/babynames
~~~

Use the __pwd__ command ("print working directory") to make sure you're in the right place:

~~~sh
$ pwd
# /tmp/babynames
~~~

## Download the file with wget

Let's assume we already know the URL of the zip file:

[http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip)

~~~sh
$ wget http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip
~~~

A little progress bar should pop up. Depending on how fast your Internet connection is, the download might take a few minutes.

TK

Is the file even there? Let's confirm it the "old-fashioned" way by using the __open__ command, followed by a __dot__ (i.e., a period) -- the dot stands for "current directory":

~~~sh
$ open .
# Or alternatively, to be explicit:
$ open /tmp/babynames
~~~

This should pop open the friendly Finder window where we can see the lone `names.zip` file listed.


## Unzip the file

Don't double-click the __names.zip__ file to unzip it. Rather, switch back to the Terminal (again, use the __Command-Tab__ shortcut). 

Then type the command `unzip`...but _before_ pressing __Enter__ -- did you already forget the name of the file you downloaded? Remember to hit __Tab__ -- heck, even if you remember the name of the file, hit __Tab__ anyway out of habit. Unless `/tmp/babynames` was not already empty, the downloaded file name _should_ auto-complete:

~~~sh
$ unzip names.zip
~~~

Run the command by hitting __Enter__; you should see the list of files zip by. Re-run the command that opens up the `/tmp/babynames` folder in Finder to verify that the files showed up.

Or, you can think to yourself, "_Gee, finding out if files are in a directory seems like a very common task. There must be a better way!_".

Then use the proper keyboard shortcuts to pop open a new Chrome web browser window and search for "how to list files in a directory". Or, I'll save you the trouble:

~~~sh
$ ls
~~~

And now we don't have to `open` a directory path just to see what's in it.

# Searching the data

Let's replicate the work in the point-and-click tutorial by finding "Beyonce" in the __yob2014.txt__ file.

~~~sh
$ ag Beyonce yob2014.txt
~~~


## Repeat, change, repeat

~~~sh
$ ag Beyonce yob2013.txt
$ ag Beyonce yob2012.txt
$ ag Beyonce yob2011.txt
~~~

TKGIF

## The power of the wildcard

~~~sh
$ ag Beyonce yob2014
~~~
