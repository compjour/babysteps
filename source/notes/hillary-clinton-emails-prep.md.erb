title: Notes about the State Department Clinton Email Dump
---


The [emails were released by the State Department](https://foia.state.gov/search/results.aspx?collection=Clinton_Email).

This Wall Street Journal scraped the individual email files and compiled them to [create their interactive database: "Search Hillary Clintonâ€™s Emails"](http://graphics.wsj.com/hillary-clinton-email-documents/).

For the exercises in this repository, I downloaded the WSJ's August file, extracted the text and saved it as a file along with each PDF, and zipped up the folder and uploaded to my own server:

http://stash.compjour.org/babysteps/clinton_email_august_pdf_w_text.zip


For my own records, here's how I produced my version of the file:

~~~sh
$ mkdir -p /tmp/blahblah
$ cd /tmp/blahblah
$ wget http://graphics.wsj.com/hillary-clinton-email-documents/zips/Clinton_Email_August_Release.zip
$ unzip Clinton_Email_August_Release.zip -d clinton_email_august_pdf_w_text
$ cd clinton_email_august_pdf_w_text
$ for fname in *.pdf; do 
    pdftotext -layout $fname $(basename $fname '.pdf').txt;
  done
$ cd ..
~~~


Zip the data and move to my AWS S3 bucket:

~~~sh
$ zip -r clinton_email_august_pdf_w_text.zip clinton_email_august_pdf_w_text/
$ aws s3 cp clinton_email_august_pdf_w_text.zip \
    s3://stash.compjour.org/babysteps/ --acl public-read
~~~
