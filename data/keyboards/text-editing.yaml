- title: Save
  keys: [Command, S]

    Although catastrophic computer crashes are rare, hitting this combo should almost be a reflex. I find myself hitting it just about every time I finish a line.

- title: Undo
  keys: [Command, Z]
  description: |
    Probably the single best reason why iPhones/iPads, with their shake-me-like-a-Polaroid-to-undo feature, will never be as suitable for editing as a full keyboard.

- title: Redo
  keys: [Command, Shift, Z]
  description: |
    Just as important as __Undo__. I don't know how many shakes it takes to do a redo on the iPhone.

- title: Select All
  keys: [Command, A]
  description: |
    Highlight the entire contents of a file. Usually preceded by a __Copy__-to-clipboard command, or any other keystroke to wipe out the contents.


- title: Copy to clipboard
  keys: [Command, C]
  description: |
    Copies the currently selected text to the clipboard. Frequently followed by a __Paste__ command.

- title: Paste from clipboard
  keys: [Command, V]
  description: |
    Pastes the contents of the clipboard to the current cursor position.

- title: Cut to clipboard
  keys: [Command, X]
  description: |
    Removes the current selection, but copies it to the clipboard.

- title: Find in current file
  keys: [Command, F]
  description: |
    In most text/word editors, this brings up a dialog/pop-up box in which you type a term to search for.


- title: Find and replace in current file
  keys: [Command, Alt, F]
  description: |
    Same as __Command-F__ to find text in a file, but with the additional option of specifying replacement text for the found text.

- title: "Find (and optionally, replace) across project"
  keys: [Command, Shift, F]
  description: |
    In a text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom, in which a project, i.e. a folder of files, can be opened in a session, this opens up a search dialog that will find a term across all of the project's files.


- title: Find file in project by filename
  keys: [Command, T]
  priority: 1
  description: |
    Perhaps the most essential command when working with a folder of files in Sublime Text or Atom. This brings up a search box and autocompletes the name of a file as you start typing it in. If you don't memorize this command, you will drive yourself crazy trying to find files by clicking through tabs or the folder structure.
