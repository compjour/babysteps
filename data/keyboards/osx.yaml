  keys: [Command, Shift, Tab]

    Cycles through applications from right-to-left. I rarely use this because when you hit __Command+Tab__ once, OS X will switch you to the last active application. If I have to hit __Command+Tab__ more than twice, to the point where going right-to-left saves me time, it means I have too many applications open.

    This is most useful within a web browser, where you may have more than one window open (i.e. one full of "work" and research tabs, the other for your Instafacechatumblr activities).

- title: Close a window
  keys: [Command, W]

  keys: [Command, Q]
